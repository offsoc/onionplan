## Structure

This research has the following major sections:

1. **Proposals**: an inventory on all ideas an existing research on _usability
   proposals_.
2. **Roadmaps**: where some of the usability proposals are selected and arranged in
   development phases inside _roadmap proposals_.
3. **Appendixes**: in-depth discussion of usability and roadmap proposals.

The overall plan is also split into roadmap tracks that may be worked by
distinct, integrated teams:

1. Health: DoS protections, performance improvements etc.
2. Usability: Onion Names, Tor Browser improvements etc.
3. Tooling: Onionbalance, Onionprobe, Oniongroove etc.
4. Outreach: documentation, support, usage/adoption campaigns etc.

Fundraising projects can integrate all or some of these items by proposing an
***Onion Service Enhancement Package***.
