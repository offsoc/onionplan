# Outreach Roadmap

* Status: DRAFT
* Version: v2022.Q4

## About

This document outlines the outreach strategy for [Onion Services][] adoption
and usage.

<!--[[_TOC_]]-->

## Improve online guides on Onion Service deployment (on community portal)

* Here: https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/
* Currently we have the following guide on the community portal which lays out
  steps for deploying Onion Services:
  https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/
* We also guide people who wish to "onionize" their website to the Alec
  Muffet's EOTK repository on GitHub.
* We need to review and improve the first guide to ensure it's comprehensive
  and easy to follow.
* This guide is also only available in English, Russian, and Turkish. There's
  an opportunity to invest in localization.

## Highlight benefits of Onion Services (on community portal)

* Here: https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/talk/
* Above page needs to be elaborated to highlight all
  [arguments](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/onion-services/onion-support/-/issues/166)
  for promoting Onion Services.

## Publish training resources (on community portal)

* Here: https://community.torproject.org/training/resources/
* We already published one general training resource introducing Onion Services
  very broadly.
* We aim to build more resources to support trainings for those wishing to
  deploy Onion Services, as well as those who're maintaining them.
* We also need to cater to user groups of Onion Services, highlighting the
  benefits of Onion Services for different contexts.

## Deliver trainings and broaden onion support

* Supporting media organizations with deploying Onion Services.
* Build conversations with organizations that are already expressing a need for
  secure and private browsing and information sharing alternatives.
* Training about Tor and Onion Services (high level understanding).
* Work to communicate the benefits of Onion Services and frame these benefits
  based on the specifice audience needs.
* The training resources should be accompanied by on-demand training sessions
  (or awareness sessions).
* Sessions should be made available for both service operators and users of
  Onion Services.
* Make it known that we provide onion support: anyone from civil society who
  wishes to deploy an onion service or onionize their website can reach out.
* We need to ask ourselves: how can Onion Services be useful and relevant in
  different contexts.

## Run campaigns

* Brainstorm campaigns around Onion Services, similar to how
  `#MoreOnionsPorFavor` which encouraged the adoption of Onion-Location.
* Reaching out to groups and organizations that we believe can benefit from
  deploying Onion Services.
* But all this depends on what the future (near or far) of Onion Services will
  look like: will Onion Services become a norm (e.g. how the web has moved to
  HTTPS) or mainly reserved for specific use cases (e.g. whistleblowing, file
  sharing)?

## Resources

* There's a [generic training resource][] to introduce onion services to human
  rights and media organizations.
* Idea to have [printables for offline trainings][].
