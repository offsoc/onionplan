# Onion Plan: Usability Roadmap - Certificates DRAFT Proposal - v2022.Q4

[[_TOC_]]

## Summary

1. All existing [certificate proposals][] are non-conflicting!
2. That means they could be pursued in parallel, so there's no block in here
   for people whishing to invest on any.
3. What _is_ limited though:
    1. Each proposal feasibility.
    2. Available resources.
    3. Results.
4. Then some prioritization/decision is needed.
