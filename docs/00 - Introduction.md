# The Onion Plan

An ongoing holistic strategy to increase the adoption an enhance the usability
of [Onion Services](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/).

[[_TOC_]]

## Summary

***Have you ever considered that we work with one of the coolest technologies?***

***And that our job consists in making it even cooler?***

**Imagine** a **communication technology** that has:

1. Built-in resistance against surveillance, censorship and denial of service.
2. Built-in end-to-end encryption.
3. A huge address space (maybe bigger than IPv6) without allocation authority.
4. Support for multiple, pluggable naming systems.
5. And that also works as an anonymization layer.

We may call this technology **Enhanced Onion Services**!

Note a shift in how the technology is presented: instead of first stating that
it's an anonymization technology, now the focus is *protection against
surveillance, censorship and DoS* with *built-in anonymity in the Onion Service
protocol*. This can make it easier to showcase the techology and attract
potential funders as more properties are highlighted.

Which features are still missing:

1. Built-in DoS resistance.
2. Pluggable discoverability (multiple naming systems).
3. Many other enhancements in usability and tooling.

The rest of this document/folder deals with **how to get there**!

## Motivation

* The usability improvements of Onion Services is an outstanding challenge
  that's being discussed for years. Now that the protocol v3 is successfully
  deployed, it may be the time to think in the roadmap for the next steps.
* There's a common feeling similar to when the privacy-aware internet was
  moving from HTTP to HTTPS, but now with Onion Services! Perhaps not in the
  same scale, but still related in terms of scope.
* But the roadmap seems to be stalled, not only for the lack of developers but
  also because we're missing a "perfect" solution that we never (and may never)
  find.
* And we don't have an Onion Service team at Tor: right now Onion Service
  development is split in multiple teams.
* At the same time, Tor cannot be responsible for domain issuance: it cannot be
  authoritative (Tor just makes the software, don't run the network and cannot
  issue Onion Names) and it's a non-profit (cannot have a revenue out of Onion
  Names issuance), which makes even harder to decide who else could be
  responsible for it and how development could be sustained.

Converging the planning, the fundraising strategy and an adoption campaign can
help put things moving forward again.

## Tracks

This plan is split into the following roadmap tracks:

1. Health: DoS protections, performance improvements etc.
2. Usability: Onion Names, Tor Browser improvements etc.
3. Tooling: Onionbalance, Onionprobe, Oniongroove etc.
4. Outreach: documentation, support, usage/adoption campaigns etc.

Fundraising projects can integrate all or some of these items by proposing an
***Onion Service Enhancement Package***.
