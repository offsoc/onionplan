# Onion Plan: Outreach Roadmap DRAFT Proposal - v2022.Q4

[[_TOC_]]

## Improve online guides on Onion Service deployment (on community portal)
* Here: https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/
* Currently we have the following guide on the community portal which lays out steps for deploying Onion Services: https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/
* We also guide people who wish to "onionize" their website to the Alec Muffet's EOTK repository on GitHub.
* We need to review and improve the first guide to ensure it's comprehensive and easy to follow.
* This guide is also only available in English, Russian, and Turkish. There's an opportunity to invest in localization.

## Highlight benefits of Onion Services
* Here: https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/talk/
* Above page needs to be elaborated to highlight all [arguments](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/onion-services/onion-support/-/issues/166) for promoting Onion Services.

## Publish training resources (on community portal)
* Here: https://community.torproject.org/training/resources/
* We already published one general training resource introducing Onion Services very broadly.
* We aim to build more resources to support trainings for those wishing to deploy Onion Services, as well as those who're maintaining them.
* We also need to cater to user groups of Onion Services, highlighting the benefits of Onion Services for different contexts.

## Deliver trainings and broaden onion support
* The training resources should be accompanied by on-demand training sessions (or awareness sessions).
* Sessions should be made available for both service operators and users of Onion Services.
* Make it known that we provide onion support: anyone from civil society who wishes to deploy an onion service or onionize their website can reach out.
* We need to ask ourselves: how can Onion Services be useful and relevant in different contexts.

## Run campaigns
* Brainstorm campaigns around Onion Services, similar to how #MoreOnionsPorFavor which encouraged the adoption of Onion-Location.
